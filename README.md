# Weekly Reports

## Week One
Surprisingly, the first week back at Uni has been quite full on, with the introduction of 3 new modules, there was quite a lot to take on, especially 220, which was quite heavy on both the theory and coding fronts, and being that I have been keeping up with my coding skills as much as I liked to have over the Summer, I found it quite hard to get back into the tasks given out by Brian, which could lead me to fall behind on my work as the weeks progress, so to overcome this issue, I will follow his tutorial videos that he has put up for the tasks and see if I can complete them, if not I'll make sure that I consult with him in the guild on Friday. 

## Week Two
This week's challenge stems from my collaboritive project with the BAs, as the programmers on my team are used to using Unity over Unreal, and although I have some experience with Unity, I feel that I will be at a disadvantage in comparison to them, where my work may take longer and may endanger the project, so to help with this challenge, I will follow the Unity Basics tutorials and get myself back up to speed with c#, meaning I will be able to keep up with the workflow that comes with the project, and not let the rest of my team down.  

## Week Three
This week's challenge came from the change of version control we were utilising for the 230 project, as last year we had used SVN, the BA team had been using perforce, and as I was outnumbered heavily, Perforce is what we're are using, so once again, I will have to learn a new version control system, as if I don't, I may find it hard to get my work and changes pushed, meaning that my work may count for nothing, so to ovecome this challenge, I will ask one of my peers who knows the system better than I do, to take me through the basics of it, such as pulling and pushing and working off of different branches. 

## Week Four
This week's challenge once again stemmed from my 230 project team, as I am not used to collaborating with programmers outside of the BSc, I was very surprised at the differences in the way at which they communicate and undertake sprints differently to us, and so I was kind of overwhelmed by the processses and differences in their work patterns, which didn't blend with mine very well, and thus I found it hard to match their expectations. To help with this challenge, I will ask my fellow team members to outline my tasks a bit more clearly and give me a time window in which to work as I don't work well without either of those to reference, as without these I might fall behind and put the project at risk. 

## Week Five
This week's challenge came in the form of the upcoming deadline for the 210 Research task, as this is the first assignment of the term, I hadn't yet gotten into the swing of things regarding time management, and thus I was left with little time to complete the task towards the end, which definetly affected the quality of my final product, and such, I don't want to this to affect me on any future assignments, so I will be readopting my scheduling methods that I used last year that proved to be effective, which will defiently be needed this year as it is much more important this year. 

## Week Six
This week was studio practice week so we had no sessions, although this brought up an issue that was more specific to my BA team dynamic, as my team have now locked into using Unity over Unreal, I am really struggling to understand the systems that the BA's have written as they code in a different style to what I am used to, with a lack of commenting making it really hard for me to infer what it all does. To overcome this issue, I will ask the programmers to have a runthrough of the code with me so that I can better understand what is going on, as otherwise I feel I will waste a lot of time running through their code and not making much progress. 

## Week Seven
This weeks problem arised from the 230 presentations, even though I covered my presentation skills a lot last year, I still feel like they let me down a lot as I find I get very uncomfortable talking to a large group and talk far too fast and mumble, which defiently detracts from the "Professional" aspect of them, I think this comes normally from a lack of knowledge of my content and thus I feel if I learn it more before hand, I won't be thinking as hard about it and thus be more relaxed, which will defiently help my overall grade and professional aspect. 

## Week Eight
This weeks problem stems from the 3 hand-ins we have this week, and although it's a better situation than last year, where there was two due on the same day, I unfortunately had to go home over the weekend, which cut a fair chunk of development time, and my lack of time management skills definitely didn't help with preperation before hand, so to help with this issue in future I will have to look ahead and build on my assignments around when they are due in, rather than work on them near when they are due as I find that my quality of work goes down when this happens. 

## Week Nine 
This weeks problem appeared during development time for the 230 game, I remembered that I had created some code for a project in college that would have greatly benefitted my contribution to the project as it would fit in directly with my tasks that I had to undertake, but I was unable to find the project, which then made me realise that I hardly if ever archive any of my work after I have finished it, which could create problems in the future such as making a portfolio or showing employers past work, to help this issue, every major project I finish I will archive so that I can access them in the future.  

## Week Ten
This weeks issue stems from the fact that this week while working on my 230 game, one of my fellow programmers pointed out that I spend a lot of time looking for solutions to problems or challenges in my code on sites such as StackOverflow and Unity forums when they can normally be found by making better use of the available documentation provided by the engine maker, which I have found is definitely true, so to counter act this issue, I will look at the documentation for the engine/language I am using before going for a general Google search as it seems to save a lot of time overall. 

## Week Eleven
This weeks issue came from the impending COMP110 deadline, with it being next week, I came to implementing the last few features to polish the project off, when I came to adding in the controls for my physical controls (Button) I found that the Vive sensor output pins are not supported in Unreal, which definitely detracts from the overall experience and meant that I had to add a work around in last minute to counter act this. To get around this issue in future, I will make sure that any features that plan to implement into my projects are supported when I am scoping them for the time frame as this will prevent me from building gameplay mechanics around features that might not be supported by the engine I am working in. 

## Week Twelve 
With this being the last week in this study block, there are of course deadlines, however due to a family event I had to attend, I had to leave on the Tuesday, leaving me with less time to polish off my assignments for the hand in that was on Friday, and although I knew that I had to leave early, I still carried on with development at normal pace and forgot to factor in the amount of time that it would take to get the projects ready for when I left, which definitely impacted on the quality of my projects in regards to polish, so to counter act this I will still have to work on my time management skills to make sure that I can get projects done on time, especially if circumstances like the one mentioned arise.
