# Weekly Reports

## Week One
Surprisingly, the first week back at Uni has been quite full on, with the introduction of 3 new modules, there was quite a lot to take on, especially 220, which was quite heavy on both the theory and coding fronts, and being that I have been keeping up with my coding skills as much as I liked to have over the Summer, I found it quite hard to get back into the tasks given out by Brian, which could lead me to fall behind on my work as the weeks progress, so to overcome this issue, I will follow his tutorial videos that he has put up for the tasks and see if I can complete them, if not I'll make sure that I consult with him in the guild on Friday. 

## Week Two
This week's challenge stems from my collaboritive project with the BAs, as the programmers on my team are used to using Unity over Unreal, and although I have some experience with Unity, I feel that I will be at a disadvantage in comparison to them, where my work may take longer and may endanger the project, so to help with this challenge, I will follow the Unity Basics tutorials and get myself back up to speed with c#, meaning I will be able to keep up with the workflow that comes with the project, and not let the rest of my team down.  

## Week Three
This week's challenge came from the change of version control we were utilising for the 230 project, as last year we had used SVN, the BA team had been using perforce, and as I was outnumbered heavily, Perforce is what we're are using, so once again, I will have to learn a new version control system, as if I don't, I may find it hard to get my work and changes pushed, meaning that my work may count for nothing, so to ovecome this challenge, I will ask one of my peers who knows the system better than I do, to take me through the basics of it, such as pulling and pushing and working off of different branches. 
## Week Four
This week's challenge once again stemmed from my 230 project team, as I am not used to collaborating with programmers outside of the BSc, I was very surprised at the differences in the way at which they communicate and undertake sprints differently to us, and so I was kind of overwhelmed by the processses and differences in their work patterns, which didn't blend with mine very well, and thus I found it hard to match their expectations. To help with this challenge, I will ask my fellow team members to outline my tasks a bit more clearly and give me a time window in which to work as I don't work well without either of those to reference, as without these I might fall behind and put the project at risk. 
## Week Five
This week's challenge came in the form of the upcoming deadline for the 210 Research task, as this is the first assignment of the term, I hadn't yet gotten into the swing of things regarding time management, and thus I was left with little time to complete the task towards the end, which definetly affected the quality of my final product, and such, I don't want to this to affect me on any future assignments, so I will be readopting my scheduling methods that I used last year that proved to be effective, which will defiently be needed this year as it is much more important this year.
